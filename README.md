Reviewed by: Joe Hernandez "It looks almost identical to the Project, you have alot of styles which is good for learning and calling things, you feel like you have more in your styles than you have in your index which im used to just trying to keep mine short & sweet, it looks good overall though have to add the "." before every img and your styles for it to work. other than that good job!
